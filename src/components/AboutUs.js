            <h2>President - Deanna Santoro, Ed.D.</h2>
            <p>
              Deanna Santoro has served Title I schools as a teacher,
              instructional coach, and professor for nearly a decade. She
              founded Write Away in 2020 after graduating from her doctoral
              program at Johns Hopkins University, where she studied using
              digital tools to promote writing achievement. Her interest in
              educational technology originated from her time as an elementary
              literacy teacher in Philadelphia, PA and Washington, DC. As a
              teacher, Deanna saw an opportunity to close the digital divide for
              her writing students by integrating technology into learning
              experiences, which she continues through the mission of Write
              Away. In addition to serving as the President of Write Away,
              Deanna currently trains teachers through her work as a faculty
              member at a graduate school of education. Deanna also holds a
              Bachelor’s degree in Political Science from the University of
              North Carolina - Chapel Hill and a Master’s of Science in
              Education from the University of Pennsylvania.

              Publishing’s history textbooks. Nathan holds a Bachelor’s of Arts
