Her interest in\n              educational technology originated from her time as an elementary\n              literacy teacher in Philadelphia, PA and Washington, DC. As a\n              teacher, Deanna saw an opportunity to close the digital divide for\n              her writing students by integrating technology into learning\n              experiences, which she continues through the mission of Write\n              Away.
