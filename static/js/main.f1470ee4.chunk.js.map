She\n              founded Write Away in 2020 after graduating from her doctoral\n              program at Johns Hopkins University, where she studied the use of\n              digital tools to promote writing achievement. Her interest in\n              educational technology originated from her time as an elementary\n              literacy teacher in Philadelphia, PA and Washington, DC. As a\n              teacher, Deanna saw an opportunity to close the digital divide for\n              her writing students by integrating technology into learning\n              experiences, which she continues through the mission of Write\n              Away. In addition to serving as the President of Write Away,\n              Deanna currently trains teachers through her work as a faculty\n              member at a graduate school of education. Deanna also holds a\n              Bachelor’s degree in Political Science from the University of\n              North Carolina - Chapel Hill and a Master of Science in Education\n              from the University of Pennsylvania.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n\n          <div class=\"about-div\">\n            <h2>Nathan Tuchman - Chief Executive Officer</h2>\n            <p>\n              Nathan comes to Write Away after more than a decade of working in\n              the nonprofit and business world.

Additionally, Nathan helped\n              transition a print publishing company to the digital world by\n              developing new platforms and strategies to drive the evolution.\n              His interest in technological equity comes from his parents, who\n              each worked in underprivileged New York City public schools, and\n              his brother, who is a lead in creating digital programming for\n              Pearson Publishing’s history textbooks.
