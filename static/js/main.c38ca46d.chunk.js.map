Her interest in\n              educational technology originated from her time as an elementary\n              literacy teacher in Philadelphia, PA and Washington, DC. As a\n              teacher, Deanna saw an opportunity to close the digital divide for\n              her writing students by integrating technology into learning\n              experiences, which she continues through the mission of Write\n              Away. In addition to serving as the President of Write Away,\n              Deanna currently trains teachers through her work as a faculty\n              member at a graduate school of education.

In the second, there were computers, but they weren’t being used consistently or purposefully across different classrooms. And in the third school, there were also computers...only, they were the same clunky desktop devices Deanna had used back in third grade herself.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          One day, as part of the studies for her EdD, Deanna was working on some research about the relationship between achievement gaps and gaps in access to technology. She came across the term “digital divide”––and immediately thought of her students.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          It struck her: no matter how hard she worked on her lessons, her students were still going to lag behind in their ability to use technology meaningfully, in the classroom and beyond.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          Deanna decided right then that she had to do something to not only address the digital divide, but also empower students and their families to understand how to use technology to express themselves, achieve their goals, and enrich their lives. So that night, she started brainstorming ideas for an organization that would address these issues. \n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          The organization would do more than just increase access to digital literacy. It would help people use technology to empower themselves and engage in the deeply human act of communicating.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          With this mission in mind, Write Away was born.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"about-div-two\">\n      <div class=\"top-div-home\">\n        <h2>Strategy</h2>\n        <p class=\"the-facts-p\">Write Away works toward this mission from three perspectives:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <u>Write Away!</u> Let’s make writing & digital literacy fun, exciting, and\n            motivating!\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <u>Right Away:</u> We must work with purpose and urgency to close the\n            digital divide and ensure students have 21st century skills.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <u>Write a Way:</u> By creating opportunities for digital writing and\n            expression, we can help pave the way for future jobs, hobbies, and\n            passions that enrich our lives!\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"mission-div ms-four values-left\">\n        <h2>Core Values</h2>\n        <ul class=\"values-list\">\n          <li class=\"values\">\n            Equity:{\" \"}\n            <p class=\"smaller-one\">\n              We work to ensure that individuals of all backgrounds have an\n              equitable opportunity to express themselves in digital\n              environments.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n          <li class=\"values\">\n            Inclusion:{\" \"}\n            <p class=\"smaller-one\">\n              We strive to create an educational context where students feel\n              safe, seen, and heard, and where they have access to technology\n              and the opportunity to participate with others in digital\n              environments.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n          <li class=\"values\">\n            Growth:{\" \"}\n            <p class=\"smaller-one\">\n              We believe that everyone is a life-long learner with the potential\n              to grow personally and develop professionally as both a writer and\n              a digital citizen.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n          <li class=\"values\">\n            Creativity:{\" \"}\n            <p class=\"smaller-one\">\n              We know writing and engaging with a variety of digital tools\n              fosters creativity, imagination, and artistic expression.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n          <li class=\"values\">\n            Justice:{\" \"}\n            <p class=\"smaller-one\">\n              We empower each other to use writing as a tool to create a better\n              world.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        {/* <img class=\"coffe-pic\" src={require(\"../phone1.jpg\")} /> */}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div class=\"about-us splash-list\">\n      <br></br>\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n      <p className=\"donate-text\">Write Away works because we’re passionate about our cause and savvy about our costs.
